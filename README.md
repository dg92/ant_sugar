# Modified Ant food problem using genetic algorithms, passing good path traits to next generation.

A small generation of ant's (dynamic particle) tries to find the path for a sugar placed at some distance that have a obstacle. If ant's collied with obstacle, it dies.

A generation live for certain amount of time and then dies.

This small project shows how ant's passess traits to their next generation to figure out the path to sugar avoiding obstacle.
